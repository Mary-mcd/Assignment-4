**Context:**
I took on the task of re-evaluating A Make-Up pallette In order to make it more accessible for a disabled user. 

**My Angle:**
Everyone deserves to use and experiment with makeup as it is a highly unique and expressive art form. It is important that everyone who wants to use makeup has access to it and can be able to use it in which ever way they like. There are many online creators who are disabled and do use makeup yet there are no products catered to them. That is why I have chosen to develop a more user-friendly eyeshadow kit and foundation bottle. Both of these items are great for all people because not only can a disabled person more easily use it but an able-bodied person can as well.
