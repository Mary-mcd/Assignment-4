**Context:**
My group and I were given the task of redesigning an everyday cardboard box and we chose to make and accessible and environmentally friendly takeout box.   


**My Angle:**
From the invention of takeout apps and food delivery services to the start of quarantine during the Covid-19 pandemic takeout delivery has been on the rise and the variety and amount of takeout boxes has grown tremendously. Because of the growth their has been an increase in waste and inaccessible takeout methods that has left consumers with more garbage and damaged food. Our grouped aimed to address these problems in our design and give people the ability to have their food delivered safely and in less harmful packaging.
